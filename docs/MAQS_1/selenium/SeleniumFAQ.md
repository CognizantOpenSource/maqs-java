## What Browsers can I use?
- Any browser that has a WebDriver.  
If you want to use a browser that MAQS doesn't natively support you can just initialize the driver yourself.
```java
this.getWebDriver = new OperaDriver("path_to_opera_driver.exe");
```
- Natively supported browsers are:  Firefox | Chrome | Edge | PhantomJS | Internet Explorer. 
Find the configuration of browsers within the app.config file and define one and only one.

- config.xml: Want to make changes to the Browser, Logging, Remote Integration Hubs, Wait times, Creating Logs, Log File Format and Log folder location? Look to the config.xml within Tests

## Why doesn't PhantomJS work
- Selenium 3.14.0 removed support for PhantomJS. Headless Chrome typically is a good substitute. 

## How do I fix common user errors?

### My code can't find the config class  
- Make sure you've imported the Full namespace such as com.cognizantsoftvision.maqs.utilities.helper.Config
### Test can't find the page element for a test, errors indicate something is wrong with Selenium  
- Kill the existing Chrome processes spawned and orphaned from the test kick off then update Browser and start fresh
### Test fails on driver, such as Chrome  
- Update the Chrome browser: In Chrome click the HotDog icon (formerly known as Wrench) > help > about Google Chrome > Update , the key is that the Chrome browser version and the ChromeDriver versions must be compatible with each other.

## Build Solution Fails
- Check if the packages are missing or your references are correct. 

## Driver doesn't want to run
- You should receive a pop-up stating Firewall blocked some features of this app.  Enable Private networks, such as my home or work network and Enable Public networks, such as those in airports and coffee shops (note this is not recommended) Finally, Click Allow Access.

## What Integrations exist?
