## Introduction 
MAQS stands for Modular Automation Quick Start - Java Edition.

It â€¦
 - is a modular test automation framework
 - can be used as the base for your automation project or individual pieces can be used to enhance existing frameworks
 - is maintained/extended by Cognizant Softvision volunteers

The main idea behind MAQS is to avoid **reinventing the wheel**. 
Most automation engagements have you doing the same basic steps to get a functioning framework implemented. 
Utilizing project templates, Maven, and utility libraries we are able to have a functioning framework up and running in minutes, almost entirely removing on the initial time investment on implementating an automation solution.
